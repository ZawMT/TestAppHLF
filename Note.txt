Preparations
=========
1: Install cURL
2: Install Docker
3: Install Gradle
4: Documentation and samples @ https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/getting_started.html

Tasks breakdown, status & issues
==========================
1: Set up try a simple app in the test network ===> INPROGRESS
	1.1: Try to start the network, check the containers === Resolved ===> DONE
	1.2: Try to creat a channel === Resolved ===> DONE
	1.3: Try to deploy a simple chaincode (referring the sample 'assettransfer') ===> DONE
		Error 1: Deployment fails, getting the error 'cannot compile the chaincode' === Resolved ===> After following the similar structure as in the sample 'assettransfer' ===> DONE
	1.4: Create an app to trigger the simple chaincode deployed ===> INPROGRESS
		Error 1: Deployment failed saying 'Cannot start the App main ... ' with ClassNotFoundErrors === Resolved ===> After having the jar files in the expected location (Need to understand better - rather than copying the files) ===> TOREVISIT
		Error 2: 'Failed to enroll user admin' from this line of EnrollAdmin.java => Enrollment enrollment = caClient.enroll("admin", "adminpw", enrollmentRequestTLS); ==>INPROGRESS
			Try 1: Use the certificates provided at fabric-sdk-java-master  === Result ===> Errors such as can't find the 'pem' files are gone, but still the user cannot be enrolled.
			Try 2: Follow the example here: https://github.com/IBM/blockchain-application-using-fabric-java-sdk 
						=== Result 1 ===> Got error at deploying while running this 'java -cp blockchain-client.jar org.example.network.DeployInstantiateChaincode'. First four got SUCCESS and but the latter four got FAILURE (Error message: INFO: Chaincode fabcar on channel mychannel instantiation java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture@2a1edad4[Completed exceptionally: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The proposal responses have 0 inconsistent groups with 4 that are invalid. Expected all to be consistent and none to be invalid.])
						=== Ignore the error and continue 
						=== java -cp blockchain-client.jar org.example.user.RegisterEnrollUser ===> Looks OK
						=== java -cp blockchain-client.jar org.example.chaincode.invocation.InvokeChaincode ===> Got error (Sending transaction proposal on channel mychannel ... Proposal response is invalid)
						=== java -cp blockchain-client.jar org.example.chaincode.invocation.QueryChaincode ===> Got similar errors (Querying queryAllCars on channel mychannel ... Proposal response is invalid)
						=== stop the network and try ===> Same error at DeployInstantiateChaincode, this time, not contiue with the following steps
						=== teardown the network and try ===> Same error and same action as above
2: Implement the requirements ===> TODO
	2.1: Basic requirements 
		2.1.1: Sending 
		2.1.2: Get balance
	2.2: Fine tuning as per requiremnets
		2.2.1: Using RSA asymmetric
		2.2.2: Benchmarking with a tool 
		2.2.3: UI app to use the service
